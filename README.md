## Background
According to TGM Research about pet care, are among the most popular and favored pets globally. In Indonesia specifically, 71% of the people own pets, with most of them being cats (75%) and dogs (14%). These statistics highlight the significance of cats and dogs as preferred companion animals in Indonesian households.

According to PetMeds about pet common diseases, the most frequent causes of death in both dogs and cats are cancer and kidney disease. The diseases can manifest through disorientation, preferring to be left alone, avoiding activities, dull coats, loss of house training habits, night wandering, and reduced appetite. Pets with poor nutrition and those with heart, kidney, or liver disease are more likely to experience symptoms that lead to death.

Based on the research and data we found,  we chose to develop an application that offers users comprehensive information about pets. This application will provide insights into various types of pets, specific care guidelines for each pet type, and recommendations for products suitable for the specific type of pet. Our primary goal is to assist users in simplifying the process of caring for their pets and making the pets happy and healthy by offering essential and accurate guidance through this application.

## Reason
Our team came up with this project based on the statistics that we found about cat and dog ownership and the cause of death due to disease. According to TGM Research, cat and dog ownership has significantly increased over the past decades. In Indonesia, 71% of people own pets, most of which are cats (75%) and dogs (14%). Based on the statistical data from PetMeds, we found out that the main death causes are by disease. Diseases can occur due to poor or unmaintained pet health. Pets with poor nutrition and diseases are more likely to experience symptoms that lead to death.
